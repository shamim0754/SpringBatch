### Concept ###
1. Job : represents sequences of actions or commands that have to be executed within the batch application
2. Step :  A job consists of many steps and each step consists of a READ-PROCESS-WRITE task or single operation task (tasklet)
..* Read :  read data from the resources (csv, xml or database)
..* PROCESS :  process it
..* WRITE :  write it to other resources (csv, xml and database)
3. tasklet : means doing single task only, like clean up the resources after or before a step is started or completed
